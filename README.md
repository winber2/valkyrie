## Valkyrie

[Live Demo](https://winber2.github.io/)

### Background

Valkyrie is a classic bullet hell game, which takes on the classic arcade style look. This was a small (but very entertaining!) project I took on for a few days to hone my object-oriented programming and my vanilla JavaScript. It features multiple kinds of enemies and a boss, power-ups, and a score counter. Scores are only saved locally, however. Hope you enjoy!

### Game

The player plays as a ship which will continuously shoot bullets at invading aliens. Enemies all have different attack patterns and movement patterns. The goal is to play through the level and reach the end and achieve the highest possible score. As a proof of concept, this small project will only showcase one level with a boss, but much more can very much be done! Despite having only one level, the game is quite challenging.

Use the Arrow Keys to move around, and hold 'z' to shoot. Pick up power-ups to increase your bullet strength. Try to kill the enemies as fast as possible otherwise your screen will be flooded with bullets!
